NOTE:

To run the "baseline.cpp" file or the "method3.cpp" file, the empty background image "empty_new.png" should be present in the same directory.
Also ensure that the video to be processed is also present in the same directory.

INFORMATION ABOUT FILES

i. "baseline.cpp"

	The file "baseline.cpp" is the baseline for this assignment.
	It takes as command line argument the name of the video file and optionally 0 or 1. (0 for showing the video while running the program and 1 for not showing it, it is 1 by default)
	Running it generates output values for frame number and queue density that are printed on the console and also stored in the file "baseline_output.txt".
	Runtime is also printed on the console and written to the file.

ii. "method3.cpp"

	The file "method3.cpp" splits each frame into divisions and gives each division to a pthread while generating output values for frame number and queue density.
	It takes as command line argument the name of the video file and the number of threads to be used (equal to the number of divisions).
	Running it generates output values for frame number and queue density that are printed on the console and also stored in the file "method3_output_THREADNUMS", where THREADNUMS is the number of threads used.
	Runtime is also printed on the console and written to the file.
	
iii. "script3.cpp"

	The file "script3.cpp" extracts resolution factor, runtime and utility from multiple files with names of the form "method3_output_THREADNUMS", where THREADNUMS is the number of threads used.
	It takes as command line arguments x and y, where range x to y is the range over which number of threads vary.
	It stores the extracted number of threads - runtime - utility values in the file "method3_runtime_utility".
	Absent files are ignored with a warning on the console while generating the output file.

iv. "plot_script3.p"

	The file "plot_script3.p" is a gnuplot script that plots the runtime, utility v/s number of threads from the file "method3_runtime_utility" generated by iv. and stores it as an image "plot3.eps".
	
v. "plot3.eps"

	The plot "plot3.eps" is the runtime, utility v/s number of threads graph obtained for method3.
	
vi. Folder "Generated Density Files"

	The folder "Generated Density Files" contains density files generated from "baseline.cpp" and "method3.cpp" and also contains the file "method3_runtime_utility" generated by iii.

BUILD & RUN Using Makefile

To compile all c++ files ("baseline.cpp", "method3.cpp" and "script3.cpp"), type "make" in the terminal.
To compile only "baseline.cpp", type "make target1" in the terminal.
To compile only "method3.cpp", type "make target2" in the terminal.
To compile only "script3.cpp", type "make target3" in the terminal.
Corresponding executable files with the names "baseline", "method3" and "script3" are generated by the above commands.
To delete all the executable files, type "make clean" in the terminal.

NOTE: You can compile the three c++ files ("baseline.cpp", "method1.cpp" and "script1.cpp") without using makefile via the following commands respectively:
	g++ baseline.cpp -o baseline -g -Wall -std=c++11 `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`
	g++ method3.cpp -o method3 -g -Wall -std=c++11 `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`
	g++ script3.cpp -o script3 -g -Wall -std=c++11

Refer to the following points for running these executables and other files:

i. Running "baseline.cpp"

	The following commands are to be used in the terminal:
	To see the video while running the executable:	./baseline video_name 0
	To not the video while running the executable:	./baseline video_name 1
					(or optionally):	./baseline video_name
	Here video_name is the name of the video file WITHOUT its extension. It is assumed that video has extension ".mp4".
	Output values for frame number and queue density are printed on the console and also stored in the file "baseline_output.txt".
	Runtime is also printed on the console and written to the file.
	If video is being shown, pressing Esc key would stop the running program there.
	
ii. Running "method3.cpp"

	Use the command:		./method3 video_name x
	Here video_name is the name of the video file WITHOUT its extension. It is assumed that video has extension ".mp4".
	Here x is the value of number of threads.
	To view the video while the program runs, uncomment the corresponding block in the source file.	
	If video is being shown, pressing Esc key would stop the running program there.
	Output values for frame number and queue density are printed on the console and also stored in the file "method3_output_THREADNUMS", where THREADNUMS is the number of threads used.
	Runtime is also printed on the console and written to the file.
	
iii. Running "script3.cpp"

	Use the command:		./script3 x y
	Here x and y determine the range over which number of threads vary. 
	The files "method3_output_THREADNUMS", where THREADNUMS varies from x to y should be present in the same folder, if not they are ignored with a warning on the console.
	The number of threads - runtime - utility values are stored in the file "method3_runtime_utility".
	
iv. Running "plot_script3.p"

	Use the command:		gnuplot "plot_script3.p"
	This plots runtime, utility v/s number of threads from the file "method3_runtime_utility".
